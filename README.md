# MONTY
**0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO**

The Monty language - Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

This project aims to learn the following:

What do LIFO and FIFO mean.

What is a stack, and when to use it.

What is a queue, and when to use it.

What are the common implementations of stacks and queues.

What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues.

What is the proper way to use global variables.

**Requirements**

The code is compiled using: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c89 *.c -o monty

Any output must be printed on stdout

Any error message must be printed on stderr

**TASKS**
